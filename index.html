                    Our home planet Earth is a rocky, terrestrial planet. It has a solid and active surface with
                    mountains, valleys, canyons, plains and so much more. Earth is special because it is an ocean
                    planet. Water covers 70% of Earth's surface.
                    Storytellers explore the nature of our planet and possible alternate realities in many books,
                    movies, and television shows. The iconic film "Planet of the Apes" (and its sequels) takes place in
                    a future in which astronauts "discover" a planet inhabited by highly intelligent apes and primitive
                    humans, only to realize later, much to their dismay, that – spoiler alert! – it was Earth all along.

                    In the long-running and re-booted television series "Battlestar Galactica" – tired survivors of a
                    war with highly evolved robots called Cylons are on a quest to find Earth, a long-lost colony.

                    In other stories, Earth has been abandoned or destroyed, such as in the Joss Whedon series
                    "Firefly," or the book and its film adaptation "The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy." In the
                    animated feature "Titan A.E." – Earth has been destroyed by an alien species, but a well-placed
                    planet builder recreates it and all the species that live on it.
